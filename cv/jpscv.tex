\section{\LARGE Research Interests}
\begin{quote}
My research is in the general areas of networking and security. I am interested in making networked systems faster, safer, and easier to build. To achieve these goals, my research bridges all layers of the systems stack, from low level hardware to high level user abstractions. I solve problems with a cross disciplinary approach, publishing in a variety of fields including networking, security, programming languages, and machine learning.
