## About Me

I'm postdoctoral researcher at Princeton University, working with Jennifer Rexford and David Walker. I got my PhD at the University of Pennsylvania, advised by Jonathan M. Smith and also working closely with Andre DeHon, Boon Tau Loo, Vincent Liu, Eric Keller, and Adam Aviv. Before that, I completed an MSE in computer science from the University of Pennsylvania and a BS in mathematics from Villanova University. 

Broadly, my research interests are in networking, security, and distributed systems. My current projects focus on making high performance networks more capable, easier to program, and more secure. My dissertation was on balancing performance and flexibility in hybrid telemetry systems. Prior to that, I did research on accelerating and modeling network security systems and, as an undergraduate, quantitative finance. 

I enjoy interdisciplinary research and often draw from areas including reconfigurable computing, machine learning, and programming languages.
