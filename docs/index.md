## About Me

I'm an Associate Research Scholar at Princeton University, interested in many areas related to networking and distributed systems. I enjoy taking a multi-disciplinary and collaborative approach, where we start by finding the best tools to solve our specific problem. Lately I've been focused on using programming languages, compilers, and verification systems to make programming the network data plane easier and safer. 

I’m also passionate about evolving research projects into open source tools that accelerate innovation and lower barriers of entry to novel technology. One example is [Lucid](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3452296.3472903), a high-level language for programming terabit-rate P4 switches that I developed with Devon Loehr, Jennifer Rexford, David Walker, Mary Hogan, Andrew Johnson, and others. In the past few years we have evolved Lucid ([Github repo](https://github.com/PrincetonUniversity/lucid)) into a platform that has enabled over a dozen interesting research projects at multiple universities, and a bunch of follow up work in our own research groups.

My other recent areas of interest include telemetry, network security, and low-overhead distributed control. I like to think about the intersection of these areas with machine learning, both as an application to support and a tool to use. My PhD dissertation (2020) was on balancing performance and flexibility in telemetry systems, advised by Jonathan M. Smith at The University of Pennsylvania. Some of the other collaborators that I have had the pleasure of working closely with in these areas include Liangcheng Yu, Oliver Michel, Nofel Yaseen, Hyojoon Kim, Vincent Liu, Nik Sultana, Joel Hypolite, Boon Tau Loo, Andre DeHon, Eric Keller, and Adam Aviv.
